<!-- 
Next tasks
For linux gui, make sure all gui apps are installed to all distros, not just few apps to 1 of the distros as you portrayed above. Apart from nix-guide and nix sample, create a new folder for nix under files, and save nix flakes etc there so user can copy paste and exicute them. 
Other than that, your plan looks good, and you can start by updating the tasks.md with the new list and the old almost complete one. -->
